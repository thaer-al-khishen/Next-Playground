Dynamic routes allow you to create pages that can dynamically display different content based on the path in the URL.

Creating Dynamic Routes: To create a dynamic route, add square brackets to a page name in the pages directory.
For example, [id].js will match any path like /posts/1, where 1 is the id.

Let's incorporate TypeScript into the mix with practical examples for static generation and server-side rendering in Next.js,
including a simulated database fetch scenario. This will give you hands-on experience with the types and interfaces that TypeScript requires.

### TypeScript with Next.js

When using TypeScript in Next.js, you'll typically define interfaces for your props to ensure type safety.
This is particularly useful when fetching data and passing it to your components.

### Simulated Database Fetch with TypeScript

First, let's simulate a database fetch function. Imagine you have a `posts` table with the fields `id`, `title`, and `content`.
Here's a mock fetch function you might use:

```typescript
// Simulated database fetch functions

interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

// Mock data
const posts: Post[] = [
  { id: '1', title: 'Next.js with TypeScript', content: 'Content of post 1...' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Static Generation vs SSR', content: 'Content of post 2...' },
];

export const fetchPostIds = async (): Promise<{ params: { id: string } }[]> => {
  return posts.map(post => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }));
};

export const fetchPostData = async (id: string): Promise<Post> => {
  const post = posts.find(post => post.id === id);
  return post!;
};
```

### Example with getStaticProps and TypeScript

```typescript
// pages/posts/[id].tsx
import { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths } from 'next';
import { fetchPostData, fetchPostIds, Post } from '../../lib/posts';

interface PostProps {
  postData: Post;
}

export default function Post({ postData }: PostProps) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{postData.title}</h1>
      <div>{postData.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = await fetchPostIds();
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const postData = await fetchPostData(params!.id as string);
  return {
    props: {
      postData,
    },
  };
};
```

### SSR and SEO

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is indeed often considered better for SEO for a few reasons:

- **Search Engine Crawling**: SSR ensures that the HTML is fully rendered when the page is fetched by the search engine crawlers.
This is crucial because, despite improvements in search engine technologies, dynamically loaded content via client-side JavaScript can sometimes be missed by crawlers.
- **Faster First Paint**: SSR can provide content to users faster than client-side rendering alone, as the HTML is already populated with the necessary data.
This can reduce bounce rates and improve user engagement, which are positive signals for SEO.

### Suitable Use-Cases for SSR

- **E-commerce sites**: Product pages often need to be updated frequently with stock levels, prices, and descriptions, making SSR a good fit.
- **Blogs and News Websites**: Content needs to be indexed quickly to rank well. SSR can ensure that articles are rendered and ready for indexing as soon as they're published.
- **Social Media Platforms**: User-generated content that needs to be immediately visible and shareable benefits from SSR for faster load times and better SEO.
- **Event and Marketing Campaigns**: For time-sensitive campaigns, SSR can ensure content is immediately available and indexable.

Incorporating TypeScript with Next.js not only enhances the developer experience with type safety but also ensures that your applications are scalable and maintainable.
Experiment with the provided examples, and try modifying them or creating new ones to get comfortable with these concepts in a TypeScript context.

The need for `fetchPostIds`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getStaticProps` in a Next.js application, especially when using TypeScript,
stems from how Next.js handles the generation of static pages, particularly those based on dynamic routes.
Let's break down each piece to understand their roles and interactions within the context of static site generation (SSG) and dynamic routes.

### Why `fetchPostIds` and `getStaticPaths`?

In a Next.js application, when you have dynamic routes (for example, pages that depend on external data like blog post slugs or IDs),
you use `getStaticPaths` to define which paths will be pre-rendered at build time.
However, `getStaticPaths` needs to know which paths to generate in advance. This is where `fetchPostIds` comes into play.

- **`fetchPostIds`**: This is a function you create to fetch or generate a list of all possible dynamic paths based on your data.
For instance, if you're building a blog, this function could fetch all the post IDs or slugs from your database or an external API.
This list is then used by `getStaticPaths` to pre-render those pages at build time.

- **`getStaticPaths`**: Next.js calls this function at build time to get a list of paths that should be statically generated.
You provide it with the paths that have dynamic segments (e.g., `/posts/[id]`) by using the data fetched from `fetchPostIds`.
`getStaticPaths` allows Next.js to pre-render all those paths as static HTML files, which can be served instantly to users.

### Did we use `getStaticProps` when visiting the path?

Yes, `getStaticProps` is used in conjunction with `getStaticPaths` for dynamic routes. When you visit a path that matches a dynamic route,
Next.js uses `getStaticProps` to fetch the necessary data for that specific page at **build time**.

- **`getStaticProps`**: This function is called at build time for pages generated through SSG and allows you to fetch external data
and pass it as props to the page. In the case of dynamic routes, `getStaticProps` runs for each path returned by `getStaticPaths`,
allowing each generated page to have its unique data based on its dynamic parameters (e.g., a specific post ID).

### Export default function Post

- **`export default function Post`**: This is the component that actually renders the page. It receives the data fetched by `getStaticProps` as props.
This is where you structure the HTML of your page, incorporating the fetched data. For a blog post,
this might include rendering the title, content, and any other dynamic data fetched for that specific post.

To summarize, in the workflow of generating pages with dynamic routes in Next.js:
- **`fetchPostIds`** is used to get all possible dynamic paths.
- **`getStaticPaths`** uses those paths to tell Next.js which pages to pre-render at build time.
- **`getStaticProps`** fetches the data needed for each of those pages.
- The **page component** (`export default function Post`) renders the page using the data provided by `getStaticProps`.

This process enables efficient data fetching and page rendering in Next.js applications, particularly for content that doesn't change frequently
and can benefit from being served as static HTML for performance and SEO advantages.
