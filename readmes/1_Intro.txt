Let's dive into the basics of Next.js by covering each point in detail. We'll start with an introduction,
then move on to setting up your first Next.js project, explore how pages and routing work, and finally, look at using the `Link` component for navigation.

### 1. Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
This is powerful because it can help improve performance and SEO of web apps significantly. Unlike Create React App (CRA), which is client-side rendered, Next.js allows for rendering pages server-side before sending them to the client. This means faster load times and a better user experience, especially on slow network connections or less powerful devices.

**Benefits of Next.js:**
- **Automatic page-based routing system**: Files in the `pages` directory become routes.
- **Pre-rendering**: By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This improves SEO and performance.
- **API routes**: Easily create API endpoints as part of your Next.js application.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**, among other styling options.
- **Development and production builds**: Next.js optimizes your application for both development and production.

### 2. Setup and First Project

**Setting Up Your First Next.js Project:**

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

4. Navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new Next.js app.

**Project Structure Overview:**
- `pages/`: Contains your application's pages. Each JS file under this directory corresponds to a route based on its file name.
- `public/`: Static files like images can be placed here.
- `styles/`: Place your stylesheets here. Global styles are usually in `globals.css`.

### 3. Pages and Routing

In Next.js, the `pages` directory is special. Each JavaScript file in this directory automatically becomes a route based on its file name.

- **Example**: If you create `about.js` inside the `pages` directory, it automatically becomes accessible via `http://localhost:3000/about`.

**Creating a New Page:**

1. Inside the `pages` directory, create a file named `about.js`.
2. Add the following code:

```jsx
export default function About() {
    return <div>About Us</div>;
}
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/about` to see your new page.

### 4. Link Component

To navigate between pages without reloading the browser (client-side navigation), Next.js provides a `Link` component.

**Example Usage:**

In your `index.js` file, import `Link` from `next/link` and use it to link to your About page:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Home Page</h1>
            <Link href="/about">
                <a>About Us</a>
            </Link>
        </div>
    );
}
```

When you click on "About Us", you'll navigate to the About page without a full page reload, thanks to Next.js's client-side navigation.
